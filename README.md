# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to improve the PlanMyTrip app by adding the weather description to the weather data. So that ustomers can use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

## Results
By testing the app, we've created 2,000 sets of coordinates with almost 600 cities identified. For each of the cities, we displayed the max temperature, humididty, cloudiness, wind speed, and even the current description. Then the customer will be easily input their desired temperature for the cities they want to travel for vacation. For testing the app, we've picked 4 cities for the roadtrip itinerary and added markers for the city and hotels info.
